### **Problem – The Silent Crisis Killing Local Manufacturing**
Imagine a small factory owner, Sameer, who dreams of scaling his business. But instead, he is stuck in a cycle of:<br />
 🔴 **Unfair vendor prices**, forcing him to pay more than big players.<br />
 🔴 **Customer drop-offs**, because he can’t offer smart discounts & loyalty programs.<br />
 🔴 **Chaotic finances**, leaving him clueless about profits, expenses, and tax savings.<br />
 🔴 **Lack of access to government subsidies**, missing out on financial support meant for MSMEs.<br />
He isn’t just struggling – he’s on the verge of shutting down.<br />
 With 6.5 crore MSMEs in India, this is not just Sameer’s problem, it’s an economic crisis.<br />
